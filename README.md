# ðŸ§° PC Builds by Denney

This repo is a personal archive of PC builds Iâ€™ve done â€” for myself, friends, classmates, and clients. Each one is built for a purpose: gaming, school, or work.

Rather than just throwing specs together, I treat each build like a puzzle â€” matching performance, budget, and real-world needs.
